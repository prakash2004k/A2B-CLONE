      <p>Our journey is a testament to our unwavering spirit and dedication; a legacy that began with our beloved founder, the late K S Thirupathi Raja. Early in life, he embarked on a journey far from home, honing his culinary skills in Chennai and Mumbai. From humble beginnings as a table cleaner, he went on to master the art of sweet-making.</p>

      <p>At one point, he had to return to Rajapalayam to take up farming on their ancestral property. All the hard work paid off and success came knocking at his door. Soon, he made expansion plans. With borrowed funds and a heart full of hope, he leased adjacent farmlands expecting greater returns.</p>
      <img src="a2b-founder.png" alt="Centered Image">
      <p>While farming was indeed flourishing, deep down, he still hadn’t given up on his dreams. In 1960, he started Guru Sweets, a small sweet shop, marking the beginning of his entrepreneurial pursuits. However, his life took an unexpected turn when a rare and devastating dust storm swept through their farmlands, leaving them completely destroyed. All the expansion he’d undertaken was on borrowed funds, crop failure due to the unforeseen disaster left him under a mountain of debt.</p>

      <p>In the mid-1970s, he made the courageous decision to relocate to Bengaluru. With the unwavering support of his loving wife and two sons, who postponed their education to help run the shop, he founded Srinivasa Sweets.</p>

      <p>His journey was defined by resilience and hard work. The family of four lived modestly, building their business brick by brick. Our founder crafted sweets, his wife assisted, and his two sons managed various aspects of the shop. Despite facing multiple challenges, their determination bore fruit, granting them a fresh start in Bengaluru.</p>

      <p>In 1979, our beloved founder, along with his sons K T Venkatesan and K T Srinivasa Raja, opened their first shop in Washermanpet, Chennai. They named it Sri Ananda Bhavan. Business thrived, and soon a second outlet was set up in Adyar. The humongous success of the Adyar outlet soon became a part of the identity. And thus was born Adyar Ananda Bhavan.</p>

      <p>Soon we expanded across Chennai, introducing a delectable range of sweets from different regions of India. Our steadfast commitment to quality and tradition set Adyar Ananda Bhavan apart in the sweets industry.</p>

      <p>In 2005, we took a pivotal step by entering the restaurant business, launching A2B restaurants alongside Adyar Ananda Bhavan sweets. This decision not only bolstered revenue but also amplified our visibility, building on our reputation for quality and tradition.</p>

      <p>Today, Adyar Ananda Bhavan is a 1200 crore plus turnover company with over 12,000 employees and global branches in the USA, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Canada and the UK. As we reflect on this remarkable journey, we proudly uphold the values that have guided us all the way - the importance of family and trust, the dedication to quality, and a commitment to giving back to society. Because this is what grew a small sweets stall to evolve into a global brand, that stands for authentic traditions.</p>
